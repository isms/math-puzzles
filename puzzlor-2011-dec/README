This is some code to solve the December 2011 PuzzlOR problem by Monte Carlo simulation:

    http://puzzlor.editme.com/DiceGame

It sets up the given dice configuration, and will take an argument for how many simulations to run. For example: `python puzzlor.py 1000` will 'play' 1000 dice games and display the outcomes in the following manner:

    Number of simulations: 1000
    Winners:
    {'A': 353, 'C': 201, 'B': 230, 'D': 216}
    Probabilities:
    {'A': 0.353, 'C': 0.201, 'B': 0.23, 'D': 0.216}

The commented out line will create a set of all possible outcomes, and can easily be made to show the exact probabilities for each die.
